# Stance on Piracy

Game piracy is a detrimental practice that harms the gaming industry and
undermines the hard work of game developers, publishers, and all the
creative minds involved in bringing us the games we love.  Certain websites,
such as [https://titlekeys.ovh](https://titlekeys.ovh/) directly endorse
piracy, and you should entirely avoid such websites in any way possible.  It
is essential to support the industry by purchasing legitimate copies of
games, subscribing to game services, or supporting developers through legal
means like crowdfunding or buying in-game content.  Game piracy not only
hurts the creators but can also expose gamers to security risks and malware. 
By respecting intellectual property rights and supporting the gaming
industry, we can ensure the continued development of high-quality games and
a vibrant gaming community for everyone to enjoy.
